# ðŸ¤– Found a Sick Way to Earn!

Whatâ€™s good, peeps? I came across a video that shows how to build an **arbitrage bot** for crypto. This is my plan for passive income! ðŸ’° Tossing the code I started working on after the video. Check out [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0-GjIm0HD0) and try it yourself, repoâ€™s open! ðŸ˜Ž

## Whatâ€™s It About?
The video shows how a bot catches price gaps between exchanges and makes money. I got stoked, started coding, and this is what Iâ€™ve got. The codeâ€™s rough, but you can test it!

## What to Do
1. Click the button and watch the video. ðŸŽ¬
2. Grab the repo, poke around the code.
3. Run the bot and see how it rolls.
